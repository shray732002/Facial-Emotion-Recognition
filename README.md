About the Project
The VGG Emotion Predictor project is aimed at utilizing the power of deep learning to predict the emotions of humans from input images. The VGG model used in this project is a convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow (or TensorFlow-GPU) library
Numpy library
Pillow library
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vgg-emotion-predictor.git
cd vgg-emotion-predictor
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

sh
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Predicting Emotions
To predict emotions using the trained VGG model, follow these steps:

Place your input images in the input_images directory.

Run the prediction script:

sh
Copy code
python predict_emotions.py
The script will process the images and display the predicted emotions.

Viewing Test Results
The results of testing the model on a set of seven sample images are available in the test_results directory. You can view these images and their predicted emotions there.

Results
The VGG Emotion Predictor model achieved impressive results in predicting emotions from images. The accuracy and performance metrics can be found in the results.md file.
